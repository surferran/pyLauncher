notes:

this is my user input to the program 'myLauncher' 
to show and help to get things done easy, relativley fast, 
while helping remembering kind of notes and links, all in orderly lists.
this is a trial to replace all kind of :
descktop notes, history and favorits links, desktop spreaded icons,
start menu.
author : ran, starting date : 30/01/16
last update date : 1/2/16
list structure will be:
{  subject name ,  subject display type,  subject image, desired image size}
sub-subjects will be prefixed and seperated by TAB key.
